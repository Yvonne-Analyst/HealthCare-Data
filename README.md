### HEALTHCARE DATA- PATIENT WAIT LIST

### Overall Objective
Track current status of patient waiting list
Analyze historical monthly trend of waiting list in Inpatient & Outpatient categories
Detailed specialty level & age profile analysis

### Key Insights from the Patient Wait List Dashboard
1. Current Status of Patient Waiting List
Latest Month Wait List: 709K patients
Previous Year (PY) Latest Month: 640K patients
-This reflects an increase of ~69K patients (~10.8%) year-over-year, indicating growing pressure on the healthcare system.
-The increase suggests capacity constraints, higher demand, or slower patient throughput.

2. Case Type Distribution
Outpatient cases dominate the waiting list.
Inpatient and Day Case volumes are significantly lower in comparison.
This implies:
Most delays are happening before hospital admission
Outpatient services (clinics, diagnostics, consultations) are a major bottleneck

3. Historical Monthly Trend (2018–2021)
Outpatient waiting list shows a steady upward trend across the years.
Inpatient & Day Case trends are relatively flat, with minor fluctuations.
Notable acceleration in wait list growth around 2020, likely linked to:
COVID-related service disruption
Deferred elective procedures
   Backlogs created during this period appear not fully recovered by 2021.

5. Waiting Time Band Analysis
Highest average wait times appear in:
18+ months
3–6 months
This indicates:
A backlog problem, not just short-term delays
Patients are remaining in the system longer rather than being resolved

5. Age Profile Insights
16–64 age group contributes the most to average waiting lists across all time bands.
65+ patients also show consistently high wait times, especially in longer bands.
This suggests:
Working-age adults are the largest demand drivers
Older patients may be at higher clinical risk due to prolonged waits

6. Specialty-Level Pressure
Top specialties with the highest average waiting lists:
Orthopaedic (Highest)
Immunology
Pain Relief
Orthopaedics alone shows a significantly higher burden, likely driven by:
Elective surgeries
Trauma and age-related conditions

These specialties are strong candidates for targeted intervention.
Actionable Solutions & Recommendations
1. Target Outpatient Bottlenecks
Expand outpatient clinic capacity (extended hours, weekend clinics)
Increase use of telemedicine for follow-ups and low-risk consultations
Introduce triage-based scheduling to prioritize long-wait patients

2. Specialty-Specific Interventions
Orthopaedics:
Ring-fence elective surgery slots
Partner with private providers for overflow cases
Pain Relief & Immunology:
Review referral criteria to reduce unnecessary waitlisting
Introduce fast-track pathways for repeat or chronic patients

3. Backlog Reduction Strategy
Focus on patients in 18+ month waiting bands
Temporary “backlog clearance programs” with:
Additional staffing
Dedicated operating sessions
Monitor backlog reduction as a separate KPI

4. Age-Based Prioritization
Introduce risk-adjusted prioritization
Older patients (65+) with long waits flagged automatically
Design targeted pathways for working-age adults to reduce economic and productivity impact

5. Performance Monitoring Enhancements
Add KPIs such as:
% patients waiting over 12 months
Median wait time by specialty

Month-over-month backlog change

Set alert thresholds when wait lists exceed acceptable limits
